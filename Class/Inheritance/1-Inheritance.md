### Inheritance

- **Definition**: Inheritance allows a class (the derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (data members and member functions) from another class (the base class).
- **Code Reuse**: Promotes code reuse by inheriting properties and behaviors from existing classes, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
- **Hierarchy Establishment**: Establishes a natural hierarchy between classes, with base classes providing fundamental functionalities inherited by derived classes.

#### Key Points:

- **Base Class**: The class whose properties and methods are inherited.
- **Derived Class**: The class that inherits properties and methods from the base class.

#### Types of Inheritance:

1. **Single Inheritance**:
   - Involves a single base class and a single derived class.

2. **Multiple Inheritance**:
   - Allows a derived class to inherit from more than one base class.

3. **Multilevel Inheritance**:
   - Involves a chain of inheritance where a class is derived from another derived class.

4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**:
   - Involves multiple derived classes inheriting from a single base class.

5. **Hybrid Inheritance**:
   - Combination of two or more types of inheritance.
   - When multiple inheritance leads to the problem of duplicate base class subobjects, virtual inheritance is used to solve it.
